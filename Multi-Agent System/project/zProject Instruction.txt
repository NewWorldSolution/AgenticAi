The Beaver's Choice Paper Company Needs Your Help!
Introduction
Welcome! Imagine yourself as a trusted and seasoned consultant specialized in building smart, efficient, and powerful agent-based workflows. Businesses rely on you to solve their complex operational challenges with cutting-edge solutions. Your latest client, the Beaver's Choice Paper Company, urgently requires your expertise to revolutionize their inventory management and quoting system. Your role? Develop a multi-agent system that streamlines their operations, enabling quick quote generation, accurate inventory tracking, and ultimately driving increased sales.

The Challenge
The Beaver's Choice Paper Company is struggling with managing their paper supplies, responding promptly to customer inquiries, and generating competitive quotes. They're overwhelmed and losing potential sales due to inefficiencies. Your challenge is to design and implement a multi-agent solution, restricted to at most five agents, capable of handling inquiries, checking inventory status, providing accurate quotations, and completing transactions seamlessly. Your solution must ensure responsiveness, accuracy, and reliability in managing requests and maintaining optimal stock levels.

Core Components of the Multi-agent System
In this project, you must ensure that the Beaver's Choice Paper Company's needs are met through a multi-agent system implementation. To maintain simplicity and effectiveness, the system should involve at most five agents. Your solution will handle strictly text-based inputs and outputs, and you will verify its performance using a provided set of sample requests. Begin your project by creating a diagram that clearly outlines your intended workflow. You may choose among three Python frameworks for your agent implementation: smolagents, pydantic-ai, or npcpy. Your completed program should contain agents that can:

Answer questions regarding current inventory and manage the reordering of supplies when necessary, demonstrating your agents' ability to use database information effectively and to make purchase decisions.
Provide accurate and intelligent quotes for potential customers by considering historical quote data and pricing strategies.
Efficiently finalize sales transactions based on the available inventory and delivery timelines.
Your submission must include:

The workflow diagram (an image file)
Your source code (only one python file should be submitted)
A detailed document that thoroughly explains the system you've built and describes how you ensured it meets all specified requirements.
You'll utilize the knowledge that you gained about multi-agent systems along with your skills in Python programming, database management (sqlite3), and an agent orchestration framework of your choice to execute this project.

Project Summary
This exciting 6-hour project is divided into key steps:

Diagramming & Planning: Create a detailed flow diagram outlining your multi-agent system.
Implementation: Develop your multi-agent system using Python and your chosen agent framework.
Testing & Debugging: Thoroughly test your agents using provided sample inputs to ensure robust performance.
Documentation: Write a comprehensive report explaining your system, your design decisions, and how your solution meets the project requirements.
Ready to revolutionize inventory and quoting management for the Beaver's Choice Paper Company? Let's get started!

Step 1: Draft Your Agent Workflow
Begin by drafting a diagram illustrating the interactions and data flows between the agents in your multi-agent system. Your diagram should demonstrate the sequence of operations for handling customer inquiries, inventory management, quote generation, and order fulfillment. Some recommended agents for your multi-agent system are as follows:

An orchestrator agent for handling customer inquiries and delegating tasks to different agents
Answer inventory queries accurately, including deciding when to reorder supplies
Generate quotes efficiently, applying bulk discounts strategically to encourage sales
Finalize sales transactions, considering inventory levels and delivery timelines
These agents should also have access to tools that allow them to interact with the system database and the outside world. Some recommended tools that might help you flesh out your system are:

A tool that checks inventory for different paper types
A tool that gets quote history related to a customer's request
A tool that checks the timeline for delivery of an item from the supplier
A tool that fulfills orders by updating the system database
Note that these recommendations for agents and tools are only recommendations. You may want to design the architecture of your multi-agent system differently. To understand more about the context of this project, you may want to do some reading on inventory and sales management in companies selling physical products.

You can use diagramming tools like Diagrams.net(opens in a new tab) or Mermaid(opens in a new tab) to create your diagrams.

Step 2: Review the Starter Code
Carefully examine the provided starter code (project_starter.py) in your workspace. This code includes essential functionalities such as:

Initializing and managing an SQLite database
Managing inventory stock levels
Generating and tracking financial transactions
Utility functions to estimate supplier delivery dates and current cash balance
At the bottom of the project_starter.py file, you'll find a provided code stub designed to help you evaluate your agent implementation. You can use this stub to test and refine your system effectively.

Spend at least 30 minutes reviewing the starter file. Write brief descriptions for each function provided to ensure you thoroughly understand their purpose and usage within your system.

Once you complete your review, revisit your agent flow draft from Step 1. Update the tools you initially outlined, replacing hypothetical tools with tools defined using the helper functions provided in the starter code based on your newfound understanding.

Step 3: Select Your Agent Framework
Decide on the agent orchestration framework you will use for this project. Your options include:

smolagents: Link to documentation(opens in a new tab)
pydantic-ai: Link to documentation(opens in a new tab)
npcsh: Link to documentation(opens in a new tab)
Make sure you are comfortable with your chosen framework and that it aligns well with the requirements and your intended agent interactions.

Step 4: Implement Your System
Using the framework you have selected, implement the agents based on the updated flow you refined in Step 2. Ensure your system follows the agent workflow diagram you drafted in step 1. Feel free to update the diagram based on changes to your approach if any hiccups arise during the implementation.

You can get started by creating different agents which accomplish each of these tasks and an orchestration agent that orchestrates the flow of control and data between the different agents. Use the helper functions provided in the starter file to aid the definition of tools for the different worker agents. Additionally, refer to the project rubric to thoroughly understand the requirements and criteria for successful completion of your system.

Step 5: Test and Evaluate Your Implementation
Test your multi-agent system thoroughly using the provided dataset (quote_requests_sample.csv). Ensure:

Your agents correctly handle various customer inquiries and orders
Orders are accommodated effectively to optimize inventory use and profitability
The quoting agent consistently provides competitive and attractive pricing
Refer to the project rubric at the end of this step to evaluate the results documented in the test_results.csv file.

Step 6: Reflect and Document
After evaluating your system, prepare a clear and concise report detailing:

A comprehensive explanation of your multi-agent system
Evaluation results (test_results.csv  generated by the evaluation code) highlighting strengths and areas for improvement
Suggestions for further improvements to the system based on the areas of improvement.
Your final submission should include:

Your updated agent flow diagram
Your completed implementation script
Your reflective report with evaluations
Ensure that you check the project rubric to understand the requirements from the different parts of the project before submitting it. You submission will be reviewed against the project rubric.
