=== CONSOLIDATED EMAIL ROUTER PROJECT PLAN ===

As a Customer Support Representative, I want the system to utilize LLM classification and vector database for RAG retrieval to automatically generate responses for routine inquiries with high confidence scores, so I can focus on addressing complex customer issues efficiently.

As an IT Administrator, I need the system to integrate with email services via SMTP/IMAP ingestion and utilize AES-256 encryption for secure communication, so I can ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations while maintaining system performance.

As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I expect the system to have a routing logic based on content analysis and previous correspondence history, leveraging the vector database for accurate retrieval, to receive only relevant and complex inquiries that require my expertise, improving my efficiency and job satisfaction.

As a Team Leader, I require the system to provide a comprehensive dashboard with metrics on response times and accuracy, allowing me to monitor system performance and make data-driven decisions for continuous improvement.

As a Compliance Officer, I insist on the system implementing RBAC with MFA for access control and complying with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations, ensuring that personally identifiable information is handled securely and in accordance with legal requirements.
