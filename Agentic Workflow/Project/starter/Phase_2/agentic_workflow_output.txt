AGENTIC WORKFLOW OUTPUT - EMAIL ROUTER PROJECT
================================================================================

Workflow Prompt: Using the product specification, create a development plan by doing these steps:
1) Generate user stories.
2) Group them into product features.
3) Create detailed engineering tasks for each user story (include Task ID, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies).
4) Generate a risk assessment for the project with mitigations.
Return only the plan steps as a numbered list.

FINAL OUTPUT:
================================================================================

=== STEP 1: 1) Generate user stories. ===
As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to automate responses to routine inquiries so that I can focus on addressing complex customer issues effectively.

As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I want the Email Router system to intelligently route complex inquiries to me based on content analysis so that I can efficiently handle specialized customer communications.

As an IT Administrator, I want the Email Router system to provide a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring system performance and managing knowledge base settings so that I can ensure the system operates smoothly and efficiently.

=== STEP 2: 2) Group user stories into product features. ===

=== STEP 4: 4) Generate a risk assessment for the project with mitigations. ===
Risk ID: 1
Risk Title: Delay in Automated Response System Implementation
Description: Delays in setting up email templates for automated responses or implementing keyword-based response generation may impact the timely deployment of the Automated Response System feature.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: High
Mitigation: Prioritize Task ID 1 and Task ID 2 to ensure timely completion. Allocate additional resources if needed to expedite the process.
Owner: Project Manager
Trigger/Early Warning: Lack of progress in Task ID 1 and Task ID 2 according to the project timeline.
Status: Open

Risk ID: 2
Risk Title: Inaccurate Inquiry Routing
Description: The content analysis algorithm developed for intelligent inquiry routing may inaccurately identify complex inquiries, leading to misrouted communications.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: Medium
Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and validation of the content analysis algorithm before deployment. Implement a feedback mechanism for Subject Matter Experts to correct misrouted inquiries.
Owner: Technical Lead
Trigger/Early Warning: High rate of inquiries being redirected to incorrect Subject Matter Experts.
Status: Open

Risk ID: 3
Risk Title: Dashboard Performance Issues
Description: Design flaws or implementation challenges may result in the dashboard not displaying real-time system performance metrics accurately or efficiently.
Likelihood: Low
Impact: Medium
Mitigation: Conduct user acceptance testing of the dashboard design to identify and address any performance issues. Ensure IT Administrators are involved in the testing phase to provide feedback.
Owner: UX/UI Designer
Trigger/Early Warning: Reports of dashboard lag or inaccuracies in displaying performance metrics.
Status: Open
