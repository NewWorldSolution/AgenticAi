=== CONSOLIDATED EMAIL ROUTER PROJECT PLAN ===

As a Customer Support Representative, I need the Email Router system to utilize vector database and embeddings for RAG retrieval to generate contextually accurate responses for routine inquiries, enabling me to focus on addressing complex customer inquiries efficiently.

As an IT Administrator, I require the Email Router system to seamlessly integrate with our existing email infrastructure via SMTP and IMAP ingestion, ensuring real-time email retrieval and preprocessing to extract relevant metadata and content for timely responses.

As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I expect the Email Router system to leverage LLM classifiers to analyze email content, determine intent, category, and confidence scoring, allowing me to receive only relevant, complex inquiries for efficient handling.

As a Team Leader, I need the Email Router system to provide a management dashboard that includes monitoring system performance, workflow bottlenecks, and response metrics based on vector database / embeddings for RAG retrieval, enabling me to accurately track the efficiency and effectiveness of our email management processes.

As a Compliance Officer, I seek assurance that the Email Router system complies with data protection regulations by encrypting all emails using AES-256 encryption, adhering to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data privacy laws to effectively safeguard sensitive information.
