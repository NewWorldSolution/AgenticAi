AGENTIC WORKFLOW OUTPUT - EMAIL ROUTER PROJECT
================================================================================

Workflow Prompt: Using the product specification, create a development plan by doing these steps:
1) Generate user stories.
2) Group them into product features.
3) Create detailed engineering tasks for each user story (include Task ID, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies).
4) Generate a risk assessment for the project with mitigations.
Return only the plan steps as a numbered list.

Risk ID: DEL-001
Risk Title: Delay in Task AUT-002 Implementation
Description: The implementation of the content analysis algorithm for intelligent inquiry routing (Task AUT-002) may face delays due to the complexity of the algorithm or unforeseen technical challenges.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: High
Mitigation: Conduct a thorough feasibility study before starting the implementation to identify potential challenges and allocate additional resources if needed. Regular progress tracking and communication with the development team can help address any issues promptly.
Owner: Project Manager
Trigger/Early Warning: Lack of progress updates or missed milestones in the Task AUT-002 implementation.
Status: Open

Risk ID: TEC-001
Risk Title: System Performance Monitoring Dashboard Design Issues
Description: Design and development challenges may arise during the creation of the comprehensive dashboard for system performance monitoring (Task MON-001), leading to delays or suboptimal functionality.
Likelihood: Low
Impact: Medium
Mitigation: Involve IT Administrators and end-users in the design process to gather feedback and ensure the dashboard meets their monitoring needs. Conduct thorough testing and usability evaluations to identify and address any design issues early in the development phase.
Owner: UX Designer
Trigger/Early Warning: Negative feedback from IT Administrators during the dashboard review sessions.
Status: Open
