=== CONSOLIDATED EMAIL ROUTER PROJECT PLAN ===

As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to automatically classify incoming emails using LLM-based classifiers, so I can focus on addressing complex customer inquiries rather than routine ones.

As an IT Administrator, I need the Email Router to integrate with our existing email infrastructure via SMTP and IMAP for seamless email ingestion, ensuring that all incoming messages are processed efficiently and accurately.

As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I expect the Email Router to utilize a vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of organizational knowledge, enabling me to access relevant information quickly when responding to complex inquiries.

As a Team Member, I require the Email Router to provide a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring system performance, including metrics on response times and accuracy, so that I can track the effectiveness of the AI-powered email analysis and routing system.

Risk ID: 1
Risk Title: RAG Hallucinations/Grounding
Description: The RAG system may generate responses based on irrelevant or incorrect information retrieved from the vector database, leading to hallucinations or lack of grounding in the context of the email content.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: High
Mitigation: Implement rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure that the RAG system generates contextually accurate responses. Regularly update and refine the vector database to maintain relevance and accuracy.
Owner: AI Development Team
Trigger/Early Warning: Increased customer complaints about irrelevant or inaccurate responses generated by the RAG system.
Status: Open

Risk ID: 2
Risk Title: Vector Database Privacy
Description: Inadequate data protection measures for the vector database storing organizational knowledge could lead to privacy breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Likelihood: Low
Impact: High
Mitigation: Implement robust encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and in transit within the vector database. Enforce strict access controls and regular security audits to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
Owner: Data Security Officer
Trigger/Early Warning: Unusual access patterns or unauthorized attempts to retrieve information from the vector database.
Status: Open

Risk ID: 3
Risk Title: SMTP/IMAP Reliability
Description: Unforeseen issues with SMTP and IMAP integration could result in email delivery failures, data loss, or processing delays, impacting the efficiency and accuracy of email handling.
